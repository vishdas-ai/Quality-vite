    IMPORTANT GUIDELINES WHEN CHOOSING THE TABLE:
    - Use qnps_embedding table if the question is about customer feedback or sentiment analysis.
    - Use warranty_embedding table if the question is about warranty claims, repair costs, or specific diagnostic codes.
    - If user aks about any particular issues choose warranty_embedding table.
    - Dont Choose the qnps_embedding table if the question is about repair costs, frequent issues, specific feature-related issues or specific diagnostic codes.
    - If user asks any particular issue like what are the issues with sunroof leakage, What are the issues with braking, any isses choose warranty_embedding table.
    
    Respond with the following information in JSON format:
    1. table_name: The name of the table to use (either "qnps_embedding" or "warranty_embedding")
    2. search_method: Either "vector_search" or "text2sql"
    3. reason: A detailed explanation for your choice, referencing specific columns and aspects of the question

    Guidelines for selection:
    - Use vector_search if:
      a) The question asks for similar or related items
      b) The question requires semantic understanding or natural language processing
      c) The question is about finding patterns or trends in customer feedback or issue descriptions
      d) The relevant information is likely contained within text fields (verbatim or combined_issue_details)
      e) The question is about customer sentiment, feedback trends, all general issues

    - Use text2sql if:
      a) The question can be answered directly using specific columns in the table
      b) The question involves precise numerical calculations or aggregations
      c) The question requires filtering or grouping based on specific criteria
      d) The relevant information is stored in structured fields rather than text descriptions

    Consider the nature of the data in each table:
    - qnps_embedding is better for questions about customer sentiment, feedback trends.
    - warranty_embedding is better for questions about repair costs, frequent issues, specific feature-related issues or specific diagnostic codes

    Provide only the JSON object without any additional formatting or explanation.
